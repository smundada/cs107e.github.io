## Goals

During this lab, you will be working on your final project for this class! We advise you to:

1.  Sync up with your team about the project (if applicable)
2.  Get a head start on your project proposal
3.  Curate the hardware you need

For the first time this quarter, we will not have a guided lab exploring some incredibly compelling, engaging aspect of computer systems with your trusty Raspberry Pi. You will now begin your own journey through systems programming! Remember, you can refer to the [project page](/assignments/project) for more information on the project itself.

## TA Check In

At the end of the lab period, be sure to confirm the following items with the TA:

* What is the gist of your project?

* What do you wish to accomplish with your project?

* Can you access the team repository?

* What progress do you expect to make this week?

* Do you have all the hardware you need? If you are working with hardware, please present us with a bill of materials, each item with an estimation of when you will acquire the materials if you do not have it.
